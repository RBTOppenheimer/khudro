# Khudro
Khudro is a very light weight web-server for Windows built with C.

The word 'Khudro' ( ক্ষুদ্র in Bangla ) means small.

There are many stable web-servers out there,
but the main purpose of this project is to
build a lightweight web-server with 
a small functionality of serving simple files.
